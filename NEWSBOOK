I am Pranav Chaturvedi 4th sem CSE student. I am making a project in software engineering, which I call as -NEWSBOOK.
In this busy world, people have no time to spend hrs in reading a newspapers, cutting out the important ones, tracking a news,
or finding details on an article.
What I propose is, these processes can be automated . 
By using NLP-(NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING) and NLU (NATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING, a computer can be taught to read newspaper. 
Many apps have been formed before, but they are not automated to that extend which this one is. 
The algorithm somewhat looks like this:-
1.NEWS from various RSS feeds(blogs,websites of newspapers) will be collected and stored in a database.
2. Through Machine Learning ,all the news will be divided into various groups-Politics,Sports,international..... and even for 
similar topics subgroups will be formed.
3.Then for each subgroup, text summarization will be done. (cleaned data)
4.Using entity recognition, for each news all important names will be known, and a summary about them will come under 
it(this year,previous year...).
If news is about any bill or amendment, it will give a short summary on them.
If news says about some Report, it will summarize it and will give you a link,below that news.
5.Using Regression algorithm user's interest in various news can be prioritize.
6. Tracked news will be available. Hence, updates on a particular news will be made available more easily.
Whole experience of newspaper reading will change.
